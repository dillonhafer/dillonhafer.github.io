title: Start multiple processes in dev env with bin/dev
tag: rails
---

Rails comes with `bin/dev` to start multiple processes from a `Procfile.dev`

```
# Procfile.dev
web: bin/rails server -p 3000
css: bin/rails tailwindcss:watch
jobs: bin/good_job
firebase: firebase emulators:start --import=./emulator-data
```

So that you can run everything at once:

```sh
$ bin/dev
ã€‰bin/dev

08:36:10 css.1  | started with pid 40039
