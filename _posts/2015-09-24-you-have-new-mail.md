title: You have new mail.
tag: workflow

Sometimes you forget to give that cron task somewhere to output its results... so it dumps them in your mail box... ðŸ“¬ðŸ˜£ all 30,000 times it failed to run.

You don't have to delete all those emails one by one ðŸ˜‰ 

```sh
echo 'd *' | mail -N
```

`d *` means delete all mail. The `-N` means:

```sh
-N      Inhibit the initial display of message headers
        when reading mail or editing a mail folder.
```
