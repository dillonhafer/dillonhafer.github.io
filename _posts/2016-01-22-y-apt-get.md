title: -y apt-get
---

When installing packages on Ubuntu, you may find it really tiring to constantly confirm 'yes' all the time. I know I did. And when it comes to scripting your installs... that really becomes a nuisance. Today I learned that `apt-get` has a `-y` flag:

```
Automatic yes to prompts;
assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively.
```
