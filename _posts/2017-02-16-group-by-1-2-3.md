title: group by 1, 2, 3 ðŸ”¢
---

Postgres allow `group by` and `order by` to reference column order in a sql statement. This is particularly useful when an aggregate result needs to be referenced in the `group by` or `order by` statement.

```sql
-- group by aggregate
select
  (created_at at time zone 'UTC' at time zone 'America/Chicago')::date,
  count(*)
from posts
group by (created_at at time zone 'UTC' at time zone 'America/Chicago')::date
order by (created_at at time zone 'UTC' at time zone 'America/Chicago')::date
;
```

becomes

```sql
-- group by 1, 2, 3
select
  (created_at at time zone 'UTC' at time zone 'America/Chicago')::date,
  count(*)
from posts
group by 1
order by 1
;
```
