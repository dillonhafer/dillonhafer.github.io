title: ðŸ”¢ CLI to bump iOS target versions
tag: mobile
---

Bumping Info.plist versions by hand can be very error prone (e.g. remembering to bump multiple targets in a project)

Fortunately Xcode's cli has an easy solution

```sh
xcrun agvtool new-marketing-version <versString>
```

So if my Application targets are at version `2.0.4` and I need them to be at `2.0.5` I simply run this command at the terminal:

```sh
xcrun agvtool new-marketing-version 2.0.5
```
