tag: workflow

The `ls` program accepts a `-t` flag to sort files by their last modified date (most recently modified first)

Example:

```
$ ls -lt
-rw-r--r--  1 dillon  staff   224 Dec   3  2016 newest.rb
-rw-r--r--  1 dillon  staff   192 Nov  16  2016 middle.rb
-rw-r--r--  1 dillon  staff   512 Nov   8  2016 oldest.rb
```
